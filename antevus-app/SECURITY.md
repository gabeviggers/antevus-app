# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Antevus platform to ensure HIPAA compliance, SOC 2 certification readiness, and general security best practices.

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Secure Credential Management
**Issue**: API credentials were exposed client-side
**Solution**:
- Moved all credential handling to secure server-side API routes
- Credentials are now encrypted before storage
- Never send actual credentials to the client
- Implementation: `/src/app/api/integrations/route.ts`

### 2. ✅ Cryptographically Secure Token Generation
**Issue**: Using Math.random() for token generation
**Solution**:
- Replaced with `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`
- All session tokens now use cryptographically secure generation
- Implementation: `/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`, `/src/lib/auth/session.ts`

### 3. ✅ Input Validation
**Issue**: Missing input validation on integration forms
**Solution**:
- Implemented Zod schemas for all input validation
- Validates API keys, URLs, and configuration parameters
- Implementation: `/src/app/api/integrations/route.ts`

### 4. ✅ CSRF Protection
**Issue**: No CSRF protection on state-changing operations
**Solution**:
- Generate secure CSRF tokens for each session
- Validate tokens on all POST/DELETE requests
- Implementation: `/src/app/api/integrations/route.ts`

### 5. ✅ Comprehensive Audit Logging
**Issue**: Limited audit logging for compliance
**Solution**:
- Added new audit event types for integrations
- Log all security-relevant events with metadata
- Include IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps
- Implementation: `/src/lib/audit/logger.ts`

### 6. ✅ Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No rate limiting on API endpoints
**Solution**:
- Implemented per-user rate limiting (10 requests/minute)
- Returns 429 status when limit exceeded
- Implementation: `/src/app/api/integrations/route.ts`

### 7. ✅ Security Headers
**Issue**: Missing security headers
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive security headers via middleware
- Includes CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- Implementation: `/src/middleware.ts`

## HIPAA Compliance Status

### Administrative Safeguards (164.308)
- ✅ Access management with role-based controls
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ Secure session management
- ⚠️ Security officer designation (organizational requirement)

### Physical Safeguards (164.310)
- ⚠️ Not applicable to software layer
- Must be implemented at hosting/infrastructure level

### Technical Safeguards (164.312)
- ✅ Access control mechanisms implemented
- ✅ Audit controls for all integration activities
- ✅ Data integrity controls via validation
- ✅ Transmission security with HTTPS enforcement

## SOC 2 Compliance Status

### Security (CC6)
- ✅ Logical access controls implemented
- ✅ Security event monitoring via audit logs
- ✅ Input validation and rate limiting

### Processing Integrity (CC7)
- ✅ Data validation schemas
- ✅ Error handling procedures
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=<32+ character random string>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32+ character random string>
SESSION_SECRET=<32+ character random string>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=<your database connection string>

# API Configuration
API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# Compliance
ENABLE_HIPAA_COMPLIANCE=true
ENABLE_SOC2_COMPLIANCE=true
```

## Security Headers Implemented

1. **X-Frame-Options**: DENY - Prevents clickjacking
2. **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff - Prevents MIME sniffing
3. **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block - XSS protection
4. **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
5. **Content-Security-Policy**: Restrictive CSP policy
6. **Strict-Transport-Security**: HSTS for HTTPS enforcement
7. **Cache-Control**: no-store for sensitive pages

## API Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Secure token generation using crypto.randomBytes()
- 7-day session expiry

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin, Scientist, Operator, Viewer)
- Per-resource authorization checks

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted before storage
- Credentials never sent to client
- Secure session cookies with httpOnly flag

## Testing Security

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify CSRF token validation
- [ ] Test rate limiting (should block after 10 requests/minute)
- [ ] Verify security headers in browser dev tools
- [ ] Check that credentials are not visible in client
- [ ] Test input validation with malicious inputs
- [ ] Verify audit logs are created for all operations

### Automated Security Testing
```bash
# Install security testing tools
npm install --save-dev npm-audit snyk

# Run security audit
npm audit

# Check for vulnerabilities
npx snyk test
```

## Incident Response

### Security Issue Reporting
1. Email: security@antevus.com
2. Use GitHub Security Advisories for vulnerabilities
3. Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Response Process
1. Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. Investigate and validate the issue
3. Develop and test fix
4. Deploy patch to production
5. Notify affected users if required

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Set all environment variables with secure values
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and test all security controls
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Complete security audit

### Monitoring Requirements
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Track rate limit violations
- Alert on suspicious patterns
- Regular security log reviews

## Compliance Documentation

### For HIPAA Compliance
- Maintain audit logs for 6 years
- Document all access to PHI
- Regular security risk assessments
- Employee training records

### For SOC 2 Compliance
- Annual security audits
- Continuous monitoring reports
- Change management documentation
- Incident response records
