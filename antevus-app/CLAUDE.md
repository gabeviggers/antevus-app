## Product Vision
**The Plaid for Labs** - A developer-friendly connectivity layer for laboratory instruments that eliminates integration overhead and enables faster experiments through a unified API. Now with natural language control - lab workers can command their instruments through conversational AI, making complex operations as simple as asking a question.

## Problem We're Solving

### Current Laboratory Pain Points
- **Instrument Data Silos**: Labs rely on USB sticks, CSV exports, or vendor-specific GUIs to move data between instruments
- **No Standard API**: Every integration is a one-off custom project requiring specific drivers and parsers
- **Poor Developer Experience**: Lab automation engineers spend more time on plumbing than science
- **Limited Visibility**: No single pane of glass view across all instruments' status and outputs
- **Compliance Burden**: GMP labs need audit trails, role-based access, and signed records handled manually across systems

## Core Solution

Antevus provides a universal connectivity and data normalization layer for laboratory instruments:

1. **Connect**: Lightweight agent discovers and connects instruments automatically
2. **Normalize**: All output converted into single structured schema (JSON/CSV)
3. **Expose**: Secure API, SDK, and event system for building automations and pipelines
4. **Control**: (Phase 2) Orchestrate and schedule runs programmatically with compliance-grade audit logs

## Target Users & Personas

- **Lab Automation Engineer**: Needs single SDK to orchestrate all devices
- **Scientist/Researcher**: Wants quick access to run results and QC status
- **Lab Manager**: Needs real-time visibility into instrument usage and metrics
- **Compliance/QA Officer**: Requires full audit trails and GMP-friendly logs

## Complete Feature Set

### Connectivity Layer
- Local edge agent (Docker/installer) for secure on-prem to cloud bridging
- Auto-discovery of instruments with zero manual configuration
- Pluggable device connectors (Opentrons, Illumina, Tecan, Agilent, Hamilton)
- Offline buffer + sync for air-gapped labs or network downtime

### Data Layer
- Universal data normalization schema for multi-device analysis
- Metadata enrichment (timestamp, user, project)
- Historical storage for audit and analytics
- Versioned raw data storage in object storage (S3/GCS)
