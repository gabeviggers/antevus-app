# Antevus Pricing & Packaging (2025)

*Last updated: September 17, 2025*

## TL;DR

* **Instrument-based tiers + modern usage meters.** Simple flat platform fee per tier, sized by **instrument count**, with metered **events/streams**, **AI tokens**, and **storage**.
* **Add-ons** for compliance, premium connectors, extra edge agents/sites, and priority support.
* **Academic program** (-40% on Core/Team/Scale) + university bundles for cores/campuses.
* **Enterprise** is a contracted sitewide license with pooled usage and 99.99% SLA.

---

## Packaging Overview

**Primary unit:** Number of connected **instruments**.

**Meters:**
* **Events/streams** (telemetry updates, run status, control acks)
* **AI/NL tokens** (LLM usage)
* **Storage/retention** (object storage, WORM exports)

**Add-ons:** Compliance Pack (21 CFR Part 11), Premium Connectors, Extra Edge Agents/Sites, Priority Support.

**BYO-LLM:** Allowed on all tiers (customer can supply their own LLM key; platform still meters events/storage).

---

## Commercial Terms (All Tiers)

* **Annual prepay discount:** -20%
* **Multi-year commitments (2-3 yrs):** -25-30%
* **Overages:** Billed monthly in arrears (see tier tables)

## When Enterprise Pricing Makes Sense

### Enterprise ($250k+) Target Segments
* **Mid Pharma / Hospital QC:** 30-80 instruments, regulated (21 CFR Part 11)
* **CDMO / Contract Labs:** Multiple clients, high throughput, compliance critical
* **Large Hospital Systems:** Central lab + satellite facilities

### Enterprise+ ($400k+) Target Segments
* **Big Pharma:** 100+ instruments, multi-site, global operations
* **Major CDMOs:** 200+ instruments, GxP validation, 99.99% uptime required
* **Academic Medical Centers:** Research + clinical, CLIA/CAP compliance

## Why This Mix Works

* **Fast self-selection by persona:**
  * **Core (≤10)** → Startup lab / single core
  * **Team (≤25)** → Growing biotech
  * **Scale (≤50)** → Multi-team R&D/QC
  * **Enterprise** → Mid pharma/hospital (30-80 instruments)
  * **Enterprise+** → Big pharma/CDMO (100+ instruments)
* **Competitive vs. market anchor:** Effective **$150-$160/instrument/mo** in Core/Team (≈$1.8-1.9k/yr) while bundling SDK, webhooks, NL control, and streams.
* **Protects margin** where costs scale: events, AI tokens, storage (not seats).
* **Simple growth path:** Add instruments at known $/instr; heavy users naturally pay more via usage meters.

## University / Academic Program

Apply **-40%** to **Core, Team, Scale** for eligible academic/non-profit research use. Enterprise (Campus/Site License) priced separately.

### Academic Tiers

* **Core (Academic)** — **$900/mo**

**Academic overages & add-ons:** Same rates as standard (Core $150/instr, Team $140, Scale $130; +$100 per 250k events at Core, tiered at higher volumes; AI pass-through + margin or **BYO key**; storage $20→$12/TB-mo). **Compliance Pack** available where needed (e.g., CLIA/GxP cores).

## ROI (Publishable Examples)

**Conservative biotech R&D:** 20 instruments × 5 runs/day × 15 min saved/run → ≈ **$388k/yr** labor savings at $60/hr loaded. **Team $48k/yr** → **~8× ROI** (before avoided integrations/downtime).

**Core facility:** 50 instruments × 4 runs/day × 15 min saved/run → ≈ **$660k/yr** savings; **Scale $90k/yr** → **~7.3× ROI**.

> *Tip: Include a mini calculator on the pricing page (inputs: instruments, runs/day, minutes saved, $/hr).*

## Enterprise Bundle Examples (No Hand-Waving)

### A) Enterprise – Regulated Site (~$247k/year)
* **Platform (site license):** $150k/year
* **Pooled usage commit:** +$30k/year (extra 25M events + 5M tokens)
* **VPC peering / private networking:** +$24k/year
* **99.99% SLA (P1 < 1h, change windows):** +$24k/year
* **Premium connectors:** 12 connectors × $300/mo = $43.2k/year
* **Total recurring:** $271.2k/year (trim SLA or connectors to hit $250k)
* **One-time:** Validation Starter (IQ/OQ/PQ) $15k

### B) Enterprise+ – Multi-Site Pharma (~$396k/year)
* **Platform (multi-site):** $180k/year
* **Pooled usage commit:** +$60k/year (extra 50M events + 10M tokens)
* **VPC peering:** +$48k/year (redundant links/regions)
* **99.99% SLA:** +$36k/year
* **Premium connectors:** 20 × $300/mo = $72k/year
* **Total recurring:** $396k/year
* **One-time:** Validation $15k (year 1)

**Negotiation Rule:** Never discount first—de-scope (e.g., drop SLA to 99.9%, reduce usage commit, fewer connectors) to hit budget.

## Segment Pricing Guardrails — "Most We Can Charge" (Good-Deal Caps)

Use **value-based caps** pegged to **~20% of conservative labor savings**; you may exceed caps **only** when bundling enterprise "price fences" (Part 11, VPC/peering, 99.99% SLA, validation kit, data residency, dedicated TAM/SA).

| Buyer | Conservative savings (labor only) | **Value cap (≈20%)** | **Enterprise fence cap** *(with compliance, VPC, SLA, validation)* | Recommended tier/list |
|-------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **PI Lab (Academic)** | $13k-$60k/yr | **$2.6k-$12k/yr** | N/A | **Core Academic** ($10.8k/yr) |
| **Core Facility (Academic)** | $200k-$600k/yr | **$40k-$120k/yr** | Up to **$150k/yr** if CLIA/GxP & validation | **Team/Scale Academic** ($28.8k-$54k/yr) |
| **Growth Biotech** | $150k-$400k/yr | **$30k-$80k/yr** | Up to **$100k/yr** w/ Compliance Pack & SSO | **Team** ($48k/yr) |
| **Mid Pharma / Hospital QC** | $400k-$900k/yr | **$80k-$180k/yr** | **$150k-$225k/yr** practical ceiling for small Enterprise | **Scale or small Enterprise** |
| **Big Pharma / CDMO** | $800k-$3M+/yr | **$160k-$600k/yr** | **$300k-$900k/yr** for multi-site with VPC, 99.99% SLA, validation | **Enterprise** ($250k-$500k/yr list) |

**Notes:**
* "Value cap" is the **max ACV** that still yields a clear **≥5× ROI** on conservative labor savings alone.
* "Enterprise fence cap" is justified only when **cost-to-serve** and **risk** rise (compliance, security, uptime, validation) and when we include **pooled high usage** (events/tokens) in the bundle.

## FAQs (For the Pricing Page)

**Why instrument-based instead of seats?** Labs buy **throughput & devices**, not seats. Seats are bundled to reduce friction.

**What if we have 12 instruments on Core?** Transparent: **+$150/instrument/mo** or upgrade to Team.

**Can we cap AI costs?** Yes. Monthly AI credits are included; beyond that, choose **pass-through + margin** or **BYO LLM key** (no AI margin).

**Do we pay for idle instruments?** No surprise usage: **events & AI** are the meters. Instruments define support/scale and fair use.

**How do overages bill?** Monthly in arrears; events/AI/storage meters pro-rate by actual usage; instrument overage is per full month.

**What is an "event"?** A discrete message in the control/data plane (e.g., telemetry tick, run status update, control ack). Bulk uploads count per 10 kB as one event (configurable for enterprise).

**What's in the Compliance Pack?** 21 CFR Part 11 e-signatures, immutable audit log export (PDF/CSV), policy renderer, retention profiles, validation artifacts.

## Sales Playbook & Policy (Internal)

### Enterprise Closing Strategy ($250k+)
1. **Anchor with Enterprise+** ($400k); if needed, de-scope to base Enterprise ($250-300k)
2. **Use pilot → step-up:** $25k (90 days), KPI (≥30% time reduction, audit-ready logs), then 12-24 month commit
3. **Value proof:** Conservative ROI calc + avoided integrations/downtime; publish metrics in Order Form
4. **No naked discounts:** Every price move = feature removal or lower usage commit

### Standard Policies
* **Segment modifiers:** Academic -40%; Startup -25% (12-24 mo); Pharma/Enterprise bundle fences
* **Pilot SKU:** $25k (commercial) / $15k (academic campus) with success KPIs
* **Discount guardrails:** Team ≥$30k ARR; Enterprise ≥$250k ARR unless SVP approval
* **Upgrade paths:** 12→25→50→unlimited instruments; transparent overage pricing

### Enterprise ROI Validation
**Example:** 80 instruments × 4 runs/day × 15 min saved = 80 hr/day × $60/hr = $4,800/day → $1.056M/year (220 days)
**$250k price = ~24% of savings = 4.2× ROI** (before avoided integrations/downtime)

---

## One-Pager Messaging (For the Pricing Page)

* **Why instrument-based?** Labs buy devices & throughput, not seats. Seats are bundled; usage is transparent.
* **Why meters?** Events, tokens, storage are our actual cost drivers; you only pay more when you use more.
* **Compliance when you need it.** Turn on Part 11, e-sign, and WORM exports when you enter regulated work; keep costs low when you don't.

---

## Appendix: Rationale

* Aligns pricing with value delivered (throughput & automation), not headcount.
* Matches market anchors (~$1.8-1.9k/instrument/yr effective in lower tiers) while differentiating on **NL control + compliance**.
* Usage meters protect margin as customers scale real-time streaming and LLM features.
