### Market Risks
- **Risk**: Labs slow to adopt
- **Mitigation**: Start with innovation labs, biotechs, not big pharma

### Competition Risks
- **Risk**: Benchling or LabVantage adds similar features
- **Mitigation**: Move fast, focus on developer experience, open-source some components

## Remember: Speed > Perfection

- Ship daily
- Get customer feedback weekly
- Iterate based on usage, not assumptions
- Sell the vision, build the MVP
- Revenue validates everything

**The goal is not to build the perfect platform. The goal is to prove labs will pay for unified instrument connectivity, then scale.**
